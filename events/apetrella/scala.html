  <h2>Introduction to functional programming using Scala</h2>

  <h3><i>Why does it buzz... in the business industry?</i></h3>
  <p>In this talk, you're gonna have a high level sight on the functional programming paradigm, expressions, immutability and alike. 	
	For illustration purpose, we’ll be live coding in Scala.</p>
  <p>With such quick introduction, you’ll master enough to catch its worth in the 
	concurrency world -- an essential piece of any cloud application. 
	One of the most popular library to take advantage of this beefed up concurrency power is probably Akka.
  <p>Drop da thing in a web server, and you’ll reach a kind-of Nirvana having a non-blocking and highly responsive and 
	scalable component -- minimizing the resource consumption. </p>
  	A logical continuation will be  the demonstration of the Play! Framework 2.</p>

  <h2>About Andy</h2>
	<p>Before getting married and having an amazing kid (whose are my biggest pride), 
		I did a graduate in Mathematics at the University of Liège that I followed with another one in Informatics.</p>
	<p>After having done my schooling duty, I mainly worked in the GIS world, participating in great projects 
		with stakeholders like the NATO or ESA -- Wherein I really enjoyed development in Java, 
		Python, AS3, JavaScript and all kindo'stuffs.</p>
	<p>Nowadays, I'm feeding myself with happiness hacking in Scala or functional programming in general... 
		through a Play! Framework 2 lens for the web part.
		Oh yes, I'm also writing a book... about Play! Framework 2.</p>
